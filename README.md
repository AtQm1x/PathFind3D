# Pathfinding in 3d space

Creates a randomly generated grid of cubes

Currently there are two algorithms avalible

the core was forked from https://github.com/VideojogosLusofona/cg_opentkbase because i was lazy

# Controls

The grid can be regenerated by pressing 'R'

The grid can be rotated by dragging [LMB]

You can move by dragging [MMB]

Breadth First Search (or BFS) can be started by pressing 'F'

A* (or at least my implementation) can be started by pressing 'G'

Press 'Q' to reset the path (allows to run different algorithms on one grid)
